# Spectrum library :rocket:
## Spectrum - N-N-N-...-N-array, eleem
## Basic plan:
You can choose only one of this commands:
*    "consol" - show function with consol
*    "html" - show function with html
*    "both" - show function both with consol and html
*    "error1" - show how function works with parameters error
*    "error2" - show how function works with system error
*    "help" - show instructions
## What function do?
Functions of another class can be as parameters of functions from this class
Class, which take parameters such as
*    another function f, that generate int;
*    length(number of digits, that we generate;
*    maxF(the max element in our generating);
*    axes(the number of axes)
*    spectrArray (grid, that we change)
It include such functions:
*    usF, that return number of none zero elements in spectrArray after all changes
*    oneDimensionalGrid, that use f for generate coordinates and change spectrArray
*    oneDimensionalIndex, that generate one coordinate from many
